# Change Tracking

One of the key features of relic is discrete change tracking, this enables integration with other reactive or signal graph
systems such as react.

Any query can be watched so that you can ask what rows were added or deleted by a transaction with `track-transact`.

```clojure 
;; given a query we are interested in watching
(def ViewModel 
  [[:from :User]
   [:where :selected]])
   
;; lets assume the state looks like this:
{:User [{:user "alice", :selected false}
        {:user "bob", :selected false}]}

;; enable change tracking for our query with watch
;; this returns a new relic database, don't worry its totally pure!
(def db (rel/watch db ViewModel))   
  
;; now we have a watched query, we can track-transact and receive changes to it.
(rel/track-transact db [:update :User {:selected true} [= :user "bob"]])
;; =>
{
 ;; the first key is just the :db as with the transactions applied
 :db {:User #{{:user "alice", :selected false}, {:user "bob", :selected true}}},
 ;; you also get a :changes key, which is the map of {query changes} for all watched queries
 :changes
  {
   ;; our watched ViewModel query from earlier
   [[:from :User]
    [:where :selected]] 
    
   ;; added rows and deleted rows are returned.
   {:added [{:user "bob", :selected true}],
    :deleted []}}}
    
    
;; you can unwatch
(def db (rel/unwatch db ViewModel))
```

You can `watch` any [query](query.md) or table.
To enable change tracking `watch` [materializes](materialization.md) queries so the same memory/performance trade-offs apply.

See the [cljidle](demos.md) demo for an example of change tracking with reagent.
